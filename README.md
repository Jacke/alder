### Exclude pattern

You can pass a string that will be parsed as a regular expression to `--exclude`:

```sh
# excluding single directory
alder --exclude=.git

# excluding multiple directories
alder --exclude=".git|bower_components|node_modules"
```

### Include pattern

You can pass a string that will be parsed as a regular expression to `--include`:

```sh
# including single file pattern
alder --include=package

# including multiple files patterns
alder --include="package|webpack"
```
